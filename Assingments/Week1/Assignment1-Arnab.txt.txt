Question 1:Do you think DL will be replacing ML in the near future? Why?
Answer:DL,the subset of ML,is the study of neural networks.The main advantage of DL over ML is that:
ML model needs guidance on making progresssive changes.If Ml hits a dead end or make an incorrect prediction,
the programmer will have to manually correct the bug while DL can work out on its own.

Question 2:What are the pros and cons of Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning?
Answer:
a)Supervised Learning-
Pros:
>We will have an exact idea about the classes in the training data.
>We can find out exactly how many classes are there before giving the data for training.
>It is very helpful in classification problems.
Cons:
>It cannot cluster or classify data by discovering its features on its own.
>Supervised learning cannot give you unknown information from the training data.
b)Unsupervised Learning:
Pros:
>It finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
>It help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
>It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of learners.
Cons:
>We cannot get precise information regarding data sorting, and the output as data used 
in unsupervised learning is labeled and not known.
>Less accuracy of the results is because the input data is not known and not labeled by people in advance.
c)Reinforcement Learning:
Pros:
>The model can correct the errors occurred during the training process.
>In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.
>It can be useful when the only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it
Cons:
>Reinforcement learning needs a lot of data and a lot of computation. It is data-hungry.
>Too much reinforcement learning can lead to an overload of states which can diminish the results.
